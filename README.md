# San Martin Store Dashboard

This project is an analysis of the sales performance of San Martins Stores in January 2021. The data was collected and analyzed using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. The goal of this project was to gain insights into the sales and customer behavior of the company, identify areas of success and opportunities for improvement, and make recommendations for future action. Through the use of Power BI, we were able to quickly and easily explore and analyze the data, uncover key trends and patterns, and present the findings in an intuitive and user-friendly format. This project serves as a valuable tool for decision-making and strategic planning for the company.
